We even drove  to  Rock Hill to the Mayflower  Restaurant  only to discover  that  it had  gone  under too!So we drove  back  to  Pineville  to Red Lobster. My wife wanted  white fish but all they had was fish and chips. We ordered  two portions  along with some  coconut  shrimp. The section  that we are in contains  several screaming children, wonderful... Our  waitress  is Eva. She brought  our drinks right away and our orders are in, hopefully  the food will be good.Well the coconut shrimp were kind of bland and the sauce that accompanied them really didn't liven them up. The fish and chips was tasty. The cod was light & fluffy & cooked to perfection and definitely hit the spot. The French fries were decent as well."

Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds, but if you time it just right... your IHOP experience can be a good one.This experience recently on a Saturday happened to be after a 4 mile run so we were super super hungry.  I was pleasantly surprised since they offer some new healthy options.  I had the wheat french toast combo with turkey bacon and scrambled egg beater eggs.  Not too bad for 490 calories.  Good way to start the day."
10/30/2011,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,TI0JhnAer_i6I1bOdrn7Vg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"iHop is one of our favorite restaurants for late night suppers. We prefer not to go when the rest of the area eats. Our experiences there have been mixed. Servers that I can recommend are Spring & Tiffany who will go the extra distance to make sure you have plenty to drink & refresh your hot maple syrup.Unfortunately we have also had servers who think that making you wait 1/2 hour or more for your check is the way to win a big tip. In that instance the server never returned & we had the meal comped by the manager who told us that she had gone across the street for baby formula. As we were leaving she was pulling up. Another server told me that the reason we had to wait so long to leave was because she had to go to the bathroom. On one of our most recent visits our server told us that the reason that our food was cold, that we got no drink refills, that he couldn't give us our check in a timely manner was because he was "" running around like a chicken with his head cut off.""My wife had ordered cheese soup & a sandwich when we had the chicken as a waiter. The soup came out cold & it resembled snot. The manager took it off our bill.On our last visit the manager served us herself & it was a great meal with excellent service. I like iHop because its cheap & you get decent sized portions. I love the all you can eat pancakes even though I can never eat more than a single plate. If you're worried about shenanigans dining there late at night don't worry. Pineville stations an officer there from 12am - 5am."
1/2/2012,2,vSsUDHU3KWEmZalyMhjLfg,6LfC9ZciJXIeZyufrXiN2A,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. Once we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience."
3/10/2012,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,TirIRoywGw6dF9ofgU4_6w,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.You might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel."
5/8/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,REZl5s85vl1weEBn-K9k0A,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,We went to iHOP this evening. Spring was out so we got served by Bob the manager. We both had sweet tea and ham & egg melts with fries. Everything was good. Bob is a good waitress. He was prompt with our drink refills.
5/15/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,qQE0xrE8-Kam0zBckuOX5Q,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,We were greeted by Tracy the manager who decided to serve us along with our faithful waitress Sky. We sat in our usual booth & had a couple sweet teas. My wife had wings and a salad. I had a burger without the bacon interwoven into it. Overall it was a good meal with a lot of iHop gossip being passed along.
5/19/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,eLDFViEOwkpDmdXFDwnyNA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Spring seated us in the back section tonight.  We both settled for sweet tea. My wife ordered biscuits and gravy. I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet with a side of buttermilk pancakes and sausage. I ate all the pancakes and most of the omelet. I think I should just stick to pancakes. Tonight we met the crazy crack lady. She appeared at our booth to inform us that her Lincoln had a leaky fuel line & what were we going to do about it? Since all the garages were closed for the evening I suggested that she talk with Tracey the manager. Tracey handed her off to someone else & she slowly started to make the rounds of the customers in the restaurant. Tracey let us out a side door in the kitchen to get away from her. LOL.
5/22/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,0UUZRL-8QBhGbi1VvhW6pw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,My wife & I were back at iHop in Pineville this evening. The restaurant was pretty empty. The manager told us that it was very full a couple hours ago because Tuesday night is kids eat free night. My wife had chicken & waffles & I had a new menu item the chicken fajita quesadilla with a side of onion rings. My wife inhaled her meal. I worked my way through mine. Ihop makes really good onion rings so it was a treat to eat there tonight.
6/7/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,Im8b4bsX6ryUV9bzZceJkA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Tonight we're seated close to the kitchen. There's a bunch of adult children seated around us. Bob is the manager tonight and Spring is our server. Matt is also serving tonight. He's as dour as he normally is. I ordered a sweet tea while my wife ordered a pepsi. I'm using a birthday coupon for a free entree for chocolate chip pancakes. Spring brought me an ice cream sundae on the house! She said they would sing happy birthday to me but I told them not to bother. The food was good. We had a good time.
6/28/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,Odoo53LtpeazqbcHwuPLyg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,It's fairly crowded tonight. I keep asking myself why on earth I would want to eat here on my birthday. The only reason I could think of was that the servers are really entertaining. Its a good place to people watch and that night there were certainly a lot of different people to observe. Spring was our server tonight. I had pancakes with hot maple syrup & a sweet tea. I guess iHop pancakes are one of my comfort foods. I've never had a bad pancake at iHop.
7/6/2012,5,guZ0Gv7YAR2hk7WTLF0HwQ,puCxVLJveBdJC_XMCm206w,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!
7/20/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,zt-k4iJfkmF05u25_xmSQg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Spring is our waitress. We went down so that my wife could get her free birthday entree. She had all you can eat pancakes. I had a short stack of pancakes with sausage, bacon, eggs & grits. The food was filling but average. Spring & Matt were the only servers. Bob was manager that night. Ihop is still good comfort food."
8/2/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,EaEkA7T7JTUHTWvmEYCTvg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Matt is our server tonight. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger and a sweet tea with onion rings as the side. My wire ordered some breakfast thing. There are five people in here including us. We'd hoped for more dinner theater, alas."
8/17/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,5-sDpn1IqfMNKHNe1191lQ,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Even though the place is almost empty there are still enough people to watch. I'm going to order the all you can eat pancakes. My wife ordered wings and a house salad. Apparently 7pm is the dinner hour for older Charlotteans. The front of the restaurant was almost full. Service was slow but there were only two servers Matt & Tiffany. Tracey was the night manager. We go there to hang out & kill a few hours so slow service doesn't matter really to us anymore. The thing I really hate is the way that the food is presented. It looks nothing like it does on the menu.
9/28/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,3Nlhm9jNmmb_v9pBWVSfTw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"The place is hopping tonight. Matt, Bina, Tiffany and Tracey are working tonight. Apparently Scarowinds is providing lots of late night traffic. There are a lot of teens here tonight and the ever watchful Pineville police officer. I ordered the ultimate Bacon something or other with pumpkin pancakes and a sweet tea. I hope its filling. I'm pretty hungry tonight. As it turned out I ate it all & it was really good. It didn't look anything like the menu though they really need to work on presentation."
10/13/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,PqFKmM30ktPDAujJohX9Aw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,It's an absolute nightmare of people tonight. I had the jack cheddar potatoes with pumpkin pancakes and extra meat. Matt was my server. He forgot the larger plate for the pancakes. Tracey dyed her hair jet black! All in all good dinner theater and average food. When I was on my way out the door I encountered a group of teens involved with saving some girl's soul from the devil. Definitely an odd night.
11/5/2012,2,0VDfL86c6eyEUufazOl2rw,9zm5l0y1-zYKcK0qonovaw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return."
11/5/2012,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,x1iQFzraf-xonLLVwomChg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes, pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.We went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average, a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will."
12/9/2012,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,cNDVVNq85jUIKFQZnmvIqA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions.
12/30/2012,4,an9xDZye6HQYsmKMLNVD0w,J2cFeQaEMq5cosxCwLbKHg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!What do I mean ""for an IHOP""?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.We're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.For as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.The dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else."
1/1/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,SJ2PDS6W6LoF1VutIfzybw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"This place is empty tonight. Spring is the only server. Tiffany is here too but she looks terrible. I ordered the 3 eggs, 3 pancakes with 4 sausage links. Hopefully it will be good. And... It was just fine. Not the best by any means but good food."
1/21/2013,2,US1xYmsm4L3kh_5Sck2Byw,sZS5xEpozcUGi6VSFkDNjg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  But.We've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.But.Beware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*As I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine."
1/31/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,lz-InDBMmiaK3r36SEyYPQ,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Colorado omelette time! It looked interesting on the menu & I thought let's try it. So much of iHop's menu is bland & boring. The Colorado omelette is the meat lovers omelette according to Tiffany. It has bacon, sausage & regrettably pot roast.Unlike the pot roast that is served as a stand alone meal the pot roast in the Colorado omelette is actually moist & tasteless. I found the entirety of it repulsive but managed to choke down about a third of it. I left the rest on the plate vowing to never try it again. As it happened it was taken off our bill. The pancakes are great as always.Ihop gets three stars for the service & the servers not the nasty omelette."
2/12/2013,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,S6yexf77Y02scUGxb3dwpw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.The other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb."
3/31/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,MILaZGJvR8XswU4efYDc3g,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again.
4/21/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,LEtkym8lK_XpKFxCS1Sg0g,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,(4/14/13) I ordered an appetizer sampler and my wife ordered chicken strips this evening. The presentation wasn't awesome nor was the food artfully arranged but it was hot & delicious!
5/14/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,-4iVs_GQ9atrkPDTSHk3sg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,I ordered the ultimate bacon and sausage platter with all you can eat pancakes. Spring is our server. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there but slowly started to attract people as we ate. I suppose that most people don't see IHop as a Mother's Day destination which was good because it was very easy to get a table. The food would't win any awards but it hit the spot & the dinner show was always good.
5/27/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,URXVj7lMP_7VtqFdCLPi6w,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,(5/24/13) Spring is our server this evening.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a side of onion rings. It was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders. The food was good but average. We mainly go to iHop to people watch & hang out with the staff. All in all a good evening.
6/20/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,ako3gBenVTQw1iiKBJCBTA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"(6/16/13) Its time to use my free birthday coupon. Argh, the menus have changed again. According to Spring the prices have gone up an average of 0.20 across the board. The new menus also are missing the side items for non breakfast foods. The pictures for each dish are closer to the ways that the dishes actually look rather than some corporate artist's fantasy.I had an omelet with red velvet pancakes & sweet tea. It was good, comfort food that hit the spot better than Red Robin did."
6/30/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,Rv-1jSAQHnuMn5JY1X1w6A,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"(6/29/2013) Both Spring and Tiffany are working tonight. The restaurant is sort of full for nearly 2300. I ordered a spinach & mushroom omelet, sausage links & buttermilk pancakes. My wife had the chicken fajita quesadillas & onion rings. Everything was great! The surprise at the end was special. Tiffany, Spring & Cindy gave me an ice cream sundae & sang happy birthday to me! All in all a very good evening."
7/14/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,jgWpzwcXjtezyC-PduvdJg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,(7/14/13) Spring is our server this evening. I had the all you can eat pancakes & my wife had chicken wings. Everything was good.
8/22/2013,4,B1kUxAfIAUDpn6ABRcsqKg,42MzpNh_TVWHu66viojzow,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"As far as IHops go, 5 stars. Super friendly service, Kay was awesome. Carolyn at check out was great too. Got my free birthday meal and just substituted it for something of equal value. Delicious breakfast and really quick."
9/17/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,NgGm_1RHAZz8Ar9HV8E1EQ,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,(9-14-13) Had a new server Nikki this evening. Spring  & Tiffany left this location. Only Matt & Cindy remain from the old crew. The food was good. I had a cheese burger & onion rings with sweet tea.(10-3-13) We once again dined at Ihop. I had a one year anniversary certificate from the online Ihop club. I got an omelet & pumpkin pancakes. Matt was our server & the food was great!
11/21/2013,5,z5K2Ez75qOXJlXJJT3-zcQ,j52rFtWbLUeVFBybx4d4bA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Go there every other Thursday for my life group bible study and they are excellent with their customer service and the food is great and they know what I want when I get there and keeps sweet tea on my table. They like us being there b/c of what we do and stand for.
1/10/2014,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,MYHfRdd6VbPUgvf5rwFjrg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,I ordered the all you can eat pancakes and four sausage links. Coty is our server though Matt & Cindy are here too. Everything was fine. It definitely was better than Waffle House.
1/19/2014,3,i0MZiMWK3X57vnLbmHMnuA,y41rJaZfQXpuXlxbmIklMg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,It's IHOP. I'm still alive. Food is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision.
2/20/2014,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,qJhZSQ5PF-XJs-c6Jf8NYg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,So I'm having the bacon and white cheddar melt on artisan sourdough bread and it's amazing! The most amazing thing about it is that it has no distinct taste other than the eggs. The seasoned fries are seasoned with salt I believe. They taste good. The grilled sourdough bread has the strangest scent. It reminds me of freshly drying paint.My wife ordered the new quesadillas. She's fully consumed one with no snide comments flying so it must be good.
4/12/2014,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,O1V6vOGzbRDthT9YVmiOtw,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Michelle is our server this evening.  I ordered a mushroom spinach burger with fries and an unsweetened tea. Unsurprisingly nothing had any flavor. The service was pretty bad as well. A shame really,  I was looking forward to chatting with Matt, but he was sent home early because it was dead. When we left there were at least 30 people there."
7/27/2014,2,8BaF--AzgXX6aAUspufopw,gNqthgyG8jVx4ZwiLjpRCA,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes.
11/4/2014,4,ybG5P8QlP5rA58yd7NRqDg,es9CjJ4OBGyU-RZNFQGN2w,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,Good clean restaurant - manager is hands on and aware of customers and kitchen staff. I sat near kitchen so it was loud - my order was steak and eggs with steak medium - came to me with well done steak - manager immediately fixed it - For lower than expected expectation the experience didn't disappoint - If your hungry for breakfast food it is a good place to go . The waitress was not much help and really apparently non existent . The check was left on my table way too early and so was she ... Don't go in with too high expectations and you'll do fine ...
7/26/2015,1,lyXB_Fr181YWY-_e1HnPsw,YaZkqPbQgOGl3_OFsi1hdg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"Terrible service and terrible food! I asked this girl twice for sausage gravy and the first time she came back with the wrong one, the second time she brought back chicken broth! Food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks. Never coming back again, it was such a waste of money!"
8/12/2015,5,fBshAG9htmxbfCeCHUbemg,luLuoMkmCCqb3c8X2Oy3yg,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"We always go here when we are in the mood for breakfast! The food is great and great priced. I've worked in the service industry for years and trust me. These people work hard, they just deal with a lot of shit! A lot of people running them to death and not wanting to tip. And trust me we know right away when your gonna tip or not. You go out you tip! Period! Anyways our most recent visit we had An amazing server.. I believe her name was Kay. I'll correct it if that's wrong... But she's the older Asian lady and she is beautifully sweet! She did a great job and made us all very comfortable. The manager and the hostess also checked on us and we loved it! She got a 30$ tip for being a good server! People start tipping your servers! We heard that day someone tipped a young girl a dollar?! A dollar?!!!! Stay at home trash! Trust me it's better if we get stiffed! But don't go out and have these people work hard and then complain because you want something for free! Pay for what you eat!!!!!!! You don't deserve anything!!!!!"
9/12/2015,1,C0QdJd6f7oPkJOttW6K_tg,bK1auwNGlLrzsaie9xDDaQ,T1jYZFB_7cqdhuvzpxfFWQ,"I would not go back here, unless I wanted to take up waiting as a occupation.   It took 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order and then another 15 minutes for a second waiter to come by and ask to take our food order who then promised to expedite the order due to the wait but blamed the kitchen for being slow.  At this point I was very frustrated but want to hang on for the kids.  Once we finished ordering, my 5 year old needed to use the restroom and wanted an escort over.  I could not help but notice that several people who had been seated right before us and others who were waiting to be seated after us had already been served their food and were half done with their meals.  Slow kitchen right.This did not improve my opinion of the restaurant nor did the drama at the table across from us. Apparently our waiter has messed up the order and served the wrong food to the table and was having to run additional food over.  Based on that squabble and another 15 minutes of waiting I decided to leave.  I could not face waiting longer and having the food order wrong and ""cold"" as the lady at the table across us was loudly declaring.In summary the service is very questionable.  You either get lucky and get your food quickly or you get stuck in limbo with no recourse.  My seven year old did not like leaving but told me in the car that we should never go back to the Pineville IHOP again ""As they broke a promise to get our food.""  I couldn't agree more."

Hopefully  the dishes  will be as tasty as I remember . The food that looked so good in the menu was a shadow of its photographic self. The food was tasty but it had no flavor. I suppose that's why there's such an array of sauces and ketchup on the table.

Never did I wait at an I-hop for my food for almost 30 minutes I wanted to walk out I was so frustrated and when we got our food the portions well I don't know what's going on but they were small leaving u hungry after u just ate!

I would not suggest this location but to drive a little extra to another location. The service is horrible, the severs are rude and the food is only mediocre. The place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible. If I had a choice, I wouldn't go back"

I'm   having a country omelet with a side  of  grits, unsweetened iced tea to drink. My wife is angry  that they no longer have sausage  gravy and that you have to ask for biscuits  as they are no longer  on  the  menu.So the current  manager  has metallic  gold hair, whoa am I back in  the  70s? My country omelet was hearty and the grits were fine after a bit of sugar was added. My wife, on the other hand was not happy that her eggs had been cook over hard rather than over medium. She had them re-cooked then had words with the server about the rest of the plate going cold. She took it back to the kitchen to be re-heated. The other issue that my wife had was that she ordered toast and no pancakes and wound up getting served both.I think that we'll wind up trying another iHop. As other diners have remarked the service has gone downhill at this one. What a shame."

The atmosphere was very warm and comfortable. Wan Fu has changed their menu radically. It used to be akin to a small novel,  now it's a two sided laminated board.  We sat down and ordered the Szechuan wonton with peanut/chili oil sauce, a spring roll , hot & sour soup & pork fried dumplings to start. All our choices were excellent! For our main courses my wife had the tangerine beef and I ordered Sa cha beef & scallops. She said that her beef was excellent and very flavorful. The kitchen apparently forgot my scallops. A manager was checking on tables and offered to re - make the dish for me. I thought that was very thoughtful but we were nearly done eating so the price of the dish was lowered to reflect beef only. He gave me a coupon for $15 off our next visit with a purchase of $50 worth of food!  That was extremely nice of him. Of course we'll be back."

We headed for waffle house instead. My wife wanted breakfast and I just wanted food.We sat at a booth and had a look at the menu. There was a wide choice of food available. I ordered a waffle, Bert's best chili and all the way homefries. Our waitress Jane was prompt with our drinks.  She did tell me that they had to throw away the chili so I ordered a ham & cheese omelet instead. I thought the food was great with the exception of the omelet. They folded the eggs over a hunk of cold cheese.  The homefries were delicious. The waffle was cold but filling. My wife didn't like her view of the kitchen and commented that my meal looked like vomit. She kept staring at me in horrified fascination as I cleared my plate.  Never again she said! I'll go back one day. As other yelpers have commented it's a very friendly restaurant with good food."
9/28/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,fs7UqtJE1E2b9mp-DbSr4g,qam5QKFE2a8MQBkxznrr3w,I went to Great Wall for lunch since I was spending some time at Carmel Commons on patrol for my company. I hadn't eaten there in a very long time. I believe the last time I was there was at a Wednesday night supper with the Queen City Corvette Club. As I remembered it then the food was good but the service was iffy. Well fast forward to September 2012. The food is still good. I had a daily special called Twice Spiced Scallops that was rather good. Their sweet tea tasted better than say sweet tea from Cracker Barrel. I was seated next to the large aquarium. The only thing that wrecked the ambiance was the small child screaming at the top of her lungs about lobsters and the clueless parent who thought that the youngsters screaming was akin to angels singing. I would have ejected both of them.

I ordered a spring roll, and an egg roll. They were fairly tasteless and warm. I think Chef Mike is at work. The spareribs were nice and hot and meaty. We saved the bones for the dogs. Our waitress gave us a small bag to put them in. Well our entrees arrived and we had both ordered orange beef. Hers was mild and mine was supposed to be hot and spicy. Mine was not spicy at all, what a shame. The orange sauce was nice but there was very little rind present. The meat was very chewy. Overall I really don't think that we'll be coming back again. Three stars for the wonderful aquariums and our waitress,  the food was a complete miss."

The food & the staff have gone through some changes, some good & some bad. We ate there last night with a friend after telling ourselves that we would never return. The food was great as was the service. I'm at a loss to explain why but I only hope that it stays that way.I had Thai ice tea, chicken satay, fried shrimp, pot stickers & Larb. My wife had fried tofu & #63. I can never remember what that is but it has wide noodles. I also had mango & sticky rice for dessert.We all thought that the food was great. The service was good. Our server was attentive but at times was a bit slow to refill our drinks. Overall I would say I was pleased & that we will be returning there again."

Though it was crowded tonight we were given a booth right away. I've ordered Thai ice tea, tod mun, chicken satay, fried pot stickers, fried tofu and a bowl of chicken Tom Yum for appetizers. My entr<e9>e,  if I still have room will be garlic prawns and sea scallops. My wife will be having #63.Well we ate our way through the appetizers... Did anything stand out you might ask. The answer surprised even me. I never thought that Thai food was supposed to not have any flavor. I never knew that it was simply a platform for the sauces,  very disappointing. The Tod mun for example was described as a blend of ground fish and best Thai spices. It had no flavor that stood out except for a slightly fishy aftertaste. It was simply a base for the sauce that accompanied it.Now the entr<e9>e,  garlic prawns and sea scallops. .. Prawns to me are seriously large shrimp bordering on the size of young lobsters. At the very least they should be as large as the shrimp that you would get in a shrimp cocktail at a nice restaurant. Sea scallops are fat and juicy with a diameter akin to a half dollar coin. What appeared on the plate were a lot of vegetables, shrimp the size of ones that you'd buy in a bag at HT and tiny scallops. There were more veggies than seafood. Bummer. I couldn't taste any garlic in the dish and asked for some garlic on the side. I guess all my time with Peter Pan made me believe that I would be given a dish of either raw or roasted garlic instead I was given a small bowl of dry garlic bits.The only things that saved the meal from being a complete disappointment were the company, the Thai ice tea and the mango with sticky rice for dessert. If I decide to eat here again I really need to review my reviews and order nothing but the Thai ice tea and the mango and sticky rice."

We had no wait to get a table and we're seated immediately. I ordered a lemonade and a mushroom swiss burger. My wife ordered sweet tea and chicken crispers. The guacamole was very filling.

The area we were seated in was filthy. The floor hadn't been swept and many of the tables hadn't been bussed. A nice young lady got our drinks for us but it took our server Davante another 10 minutes to show up at our table and take our orders. My wife's salad arrived first. She said it was okay. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the salad. She had smoked wings with ranch dressing, they arrived with barbecue sauce. I had the Ancho salmon. It was over cooked and tasteless. We had to ask the guy delivering the food to refill our drinks since Davante was too busy chatting in the kitchen to do his job. When it came time to leave he was nowhere to be found so we used the electronic check out. My wife was so displeased that she complained about the meal on the Chili's website."
3/5/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,icA26WluKEtsy62gfGWVlQ,eMFD4FA8NVAlUAeBl4EVNw,I had lunch here today with some friends from work. They were slammed with people but everything moved very smoothly. I ordered an Italian BMT & had it in about 5 minutes in spite of the 6-7 people that were in front of me.
3/17/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,saI-__ILHcY6bN6iAMECTA,eMFD4FA8NVAlUAeBl4EVNw,Bought a 6 inch combo Italian bmt sub for lunch. Th efficient crew had almost no patrons although the St. Patrick's parade was starting to wind down & the streets were filled with hungry people. The manager that was there was the same one that was there on my last visit. I made the sandwich a combo with the edition of a bag of chips & a medium drink.

The service has always been quick and they've never gotten an order wrong. Its just too bad that the food goes right through me. I think the strangest thing I've eaten so far was a Volcano Burrito with fire sauce. Do not eat something like this before you go on a long car ride or without having Immodium handy.

It does have a too large feeling but both times I've been there there have been a good amount of people. But the best thing about Ishi is their sushi. Its fresh. They have a lot of different rolls but they also have many types of fish that I haven't seen listed on the menus of restaurants in South Charlotte. I particularly like Wahoo.Both times I was there I ordered 15 pieces of salmon nigiri & 2 of wahoo. I seemed to be the only one eating sushi. Most of the other patrons seemed to have very little time for lunch & were ordering lunch specials. THe chef visited my table the last time & presented me with an orange. It was the perfect way to end the meal.My waiters both times have been polite & efficient.
3/3/2014,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,#NAME?,eNepNrx9dzehOql6fKxW3Q,I tried the smokehouse brisket with curly fries and a large drink. The combo price listed on the board and the total amount seemed very far apart. Anyhow the food was out quickly. I went and sat down and began eating. The fries were initially hot but got cold quickly. The sandwich was cold from the get go. It was pretty tasty but it was still cold. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance inside and it was very clean. The staff was very polite. I will probably eat here again if I have a hankering for fast food.

I have a new favorite sub chain & that chain is Firehouse. On the outside Firehouse doesn't appear to be any different than any other sub shop. The interior is where the magic begins. In keeping with its name the interior walls are decorated with firefighting memorabilia. The Starmount store has a large mural of Engine Company #12 arriving at a blazing house ready to do battle with the flames.It also seems to be a favorite place to eat with first responders. I have tried the meatball sub combos on two visits. Both times the sub was served piping hot from an oven. They were very tasty & very filling. I also tried the beef brisket one. I also liberally spread Captain Sorenson's Datil Pepper Sauce on that sub. It has a sweet hot flavor that really starts burning when it wants to leave your body!"

It isn't on the menu anymore but it was very tasty.  The backdraft hot sauce complimented it nicely. I've tried most everything on the menu at this point and all of it is pretty good. I'm now letting them surprise me and it seems to be working out pretty well.
12/14/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,7ETimBLuvcb12ZUURr7b-w,6LoNRotewF81fxka6L_8Jw,"So I had a meatball sub this afternoon. It was very good as always. Then later this evening I decided to try their chili. That was a mistake. The chili is relegated to side items for a reason. First off it is continuously heated in a container all day long. It is served in a small plastic bowl which is actually fortunate because you don't have much to eat. The chili is pretty watery. It needs to be thicker, two packs of crackers are provided for this purpose. But the lack of thickness is a front for the lack of substance. The chili doesn't have a lot of meat, beans or flavor. I added a hot sauce that I liked called Backdraft. The sauce provided flavor but did not draw out any from the chili. My stars represent the service and the sub I had earlier. The chili gets no stars from me."

I ordered a Sriracha beef fully involved. I don't know what to expect so I'm eagerly awaiting my sandwich. Okay so it's a lot smaller than a sub, maybe 6"" long. The first taste is the chili paste hot sauce. The beef itself has no distinct flavor. I'd have to say its a miss as far as I'm concerned. Its all heat and no flavor. Disappointing. I spoke with one of the corporate trainers who told me that the sandwich is built around the sauce. Apparently the sauce raises the metabolism and enhances weight loss. I find that claim questionable. It also would mean that the sandwich is simply a carrier for the sauce. I'm sure that Firehouse will also sell the sauce as a stand alone item. I watched the trainer prepare a basic salad. After he was done he gave it to me. Firehouse food is always served in red plastic containers that seem to resemble airborne gurneys that one would winch into a helicopter. The salad is served in a rounded red bowl that seems to be the perfect size for cereal,  dog food, etc. I think they'll lose a lot of bowls! As for the salad, well it's a salad. A mixture of lettuce,  bell peppers,  cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, cheese and 2 pepperocini. Dressing is added then the salad is tossed for 30 seconds. It distributes the dressing nicely. Trying to eat a large bowl of salad after the sandwich was a chore. What I noticed most about the salad was that every ingredient looked as though it had been run through a wood chipper. Every veggie was in tiny pieces. Its a lot of salad for the money."

Jarvis took my first one back because he said it had a hair on it. It's currently being re-made.So the sandwich appears and I'm getting excited till I bite into it... and it has no flavor?  Captain Sorenson's datil pepper hot sauce has great flavor.  Its akin to a hot ketchup. This is not looking good. But there's another disturbing discovery just below the bun. The grilled chicken has a rubbery texture. At first I thought it might not have been cooked, but it wasn't raw. It just has a weird texture to it. Even fully involved it had no flavor till I smothered it in Cap'n Sorensen's sauce. Two strikes..."

I had been talking to an employee and he felt that I wasn't giving the sandwiches the chance they deserved. I'm going to try the turkey with salsa verde.Now this is a good tasting sandwich!  The salsa verde compliments the turkey nicely. The lettuce is nice and crispy. The turkey has a nice smoked flavor that compliments the salsa nicely. Everything tastes good! You knocked it out of the park with this one guys!To be fair each of the sandwiches are carefully designed and paired with items that compliment one another while akeeping the calorie count below 500. As anyone who's ever attempted a diet knows it's extremely difficult to make a meal that's both hearty and flavorful. Flavor components that most of us think have no bearing on calories can really add calories to a dish. So unknown employee, thank you for making my Firehouse supper amazing!I'm sitting back down. I want another one!"

I don't know who crafted it but they did a great job. It was nice and messy. Firehouse is definitely the place to be on a cold day.

It's a nice wet sandwich that's full of flavor and fills one up nicely. It is definitely one of my favorite sandwiches even though I've been on an Italian sub kick this past week. The atmosphere today is playful. It's a brisk day today but it's nice and warm in firehouse. There is a basketball game on the televisions and a medium amount of diners. A perfect atmosphere in which to enjoy a meal.

Rarely do people view subs as comfort food. Yet a Firehouse Italian sub is very much comfort food. Today I had a large Italian sub fully involved crafted by Mike Shingle. Everything was in it place in perfect proportion. For a day like today when it's freezing cold and the wind makes you bow your head to escape its fury, you can count on Firehouse providing the best comfort food to warm you up and let you meet the cold head on.

I had one for supper this evening. It was nicely crafted by Greg Gimon. The sandwich is a nicely balanced combination of beef and Siracca hot sauce. The sauce grows on you. I had first likened it to eating a flamethrower but it has a nice flavor component all its own. I do admit that I asked for a small taster cup with extra sauce. I tend to like my sandwiches wet. All in all it was a good hearty sandwich that really sated my hunger. I'm looking forward to eating my next one.

My memory of the hook and ladder sub is fuzzy at best, so it was a completely new taste for me. The sandwich has a slightly smokey and sweet taste that is delicious. If I closed my eyes I could imagine that I was holding a medium or even a large sub. The sandwich was crafted by Mike Shingle and as always he did a superb job. The Hook and Ladder light joins my list of great sandwiches. Bravo Firehouse!"

A joint effort by Mr. Gimon and Mr.Flenor crafted beautifully and very tasty.Thank you Firehouse challenge for the combo coupon!

Should I stay with the familiar or blaze off into the unknown. ..? Of course I picked the unknown. So the sandwich was crafted by Mike Goss and Damien. The first bite reminded me of Thanksgiving dinner minus the stuffing, thankfully the delicious pickle fills in nicely. Like the turkey salsa verde sandwich this sandwich has a nice smoked flavor thanks to the turkey with a sweet lingering finish courtesy of the cranberry.  Another great sandwich! Thanks Firehouse!"

I have been doing the Firehouse Subs challenge online on their website and have received some great coupons.

As usual it was very well made and delicious.  (03/15/14) Mike and Greg are working second shift again today. What to have what to have... I again decided on an Italian sub.

I'm sick of driving all over East Charlotte in an attempt to find something better than a 2 star restaurant and more importantly one that takes American Express. The restaurant is pretty empty. I thinly my waitress's name is Angie. The pretzels were pretty good but overpriced. The quesadillas were flavorless and filled with fatty meat. Ugh. Unfortunately with a tip included the bill was $23. That's way too much for mediocre food. The Chili's on my side of town has better food than this one does. I won't be returning.

So... the first time my wife & I ate here was when they opened in this location. It wasn't a good experience but the food was good. Fast forward to the future. Picture if you will, a couple driving around at 8pm confused as to where to eat, Red Robin beckons with its faux diner lights. We enter the restaurant & its nearly empty. We both look at one another with a wtf look on our faces. Eight pm and there's no one in the bar & the restaurant is nearly empty, what gives? No one seemed to know. Our hostess took us to a table that had an empty bottle of ketchup and no tableware. We didn't notice that fact till we needed napkins.I ordered a black Russian. What arrived was a black martini? WTF? That drink was sent back and eventually the black Russian appeared. I had to nurse it though. It was a very small drink. :( We ordered guacamole, salsa & chips as an appetizer. It had a couple very large homemade chips, some regular sized chips & two chip baskets that held the guacamole & salsa respectively. Cute idea but neither chip cup held enough of either. However it was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders & I had a Chophouse Burger. The burger was very good. I really appreciate Red Robin's wrappers around the burgers. They really make eating burgers a pleasure.  Our server's name was Matt. A nice & polite young man. Should we dine there again we'll ask for him."
5/15/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,ZFTALEt73BVdEO8ANUedCQ,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"We sat at the bar. Our server was Dena. My wife ordered the royal red robin without the special sauce. I ordered a burning love, god help me. The burgers were good. Mine was very filling. My wife wolfed hers down in what seemed like seconds. I was more leisurely in consuming mine. I actually made it home before the root beer float decided that it wanted out. I made the mistake of getting three refills on the float. But in my defense it was yummy! The burnin love burger wasn't overly spicy but my lips were tingling by the time I had nearly finished the burger so I was hoping to get home before it wanted out as well. Dena was a good server. She anticipated our needs and was prompt with drink refills. My burger was great."
6/7/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,EFxkBDUpYlvYHZYxKGEt3Q,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,I ordered a root beer float and a guacamole bacon burger. My wife ordered a sweet tea. I had a coupon for a free burger since my birthday is in June. They finally have soda glasses but the straws aren't long enough to poke out of them comfortably. They need longer straws. The burger was great. All in all a nice meal.
6/29/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,G8NJ3WK0Hm-pvTAwPGo7_g,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,The guy who was going to seat us led us into the main dining room. Damn its really hard to see what incredible pigs people are. I feel sorry for the people that have to clean up after them. We're seated in the bar area. We ordered the guacamole and chips. The chips used to be made in the kitchen qnd came in a basket. Now a wire stand has two small containers of salsa and guacamole with a small amount of chips in the center. So far we have eaten all the chips and are waiting on a refill. The chips when they arrived were piping hot. We ate the rest of the salsa and the guacamole. My wife had chicken tenders and she thought they were good. My burger was good to but man was it spicy! They used fresh raw jalapeno peppers. I could only fit a couple root beer floats into me. All in all it was a good supper.
7/4/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,N7bCvKY72jpC7j-AdZdqKQ,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,We decide to eat at Red Robin tonight because of the heat. We made use of the free appetizer offer I received via my red royalty card. We got a double sampler of onion rings and cheese sticks. I have to say that I've had better onion rings at iHop. The rings were medium sized. They were coated with a very crunchy breaded batter that I didn't care for. My wife thought the cheese sticks were fine. My wife ordered the cluckers and fries and I had a crybaby burger.The crybaby burger was strange in that the ghost sauce had an odd taste to it. The waiitress told me it was because of the burger being layered with two kinds of onions but I could definitely taste something off in the sauce. Anyhow the burger was good & I was hungry so it was a winning combination.
8/2/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,PE2pSP74Y9hjPunzTtaa5Q,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"Starting the evening off with a double starter of cheese sticks and jalapeno coins to be followed by a fiery ghost burger. As usual I'm having a bottomless rootbeer float.Lydia was our server. Everything was great, no screaming kids or unruly drunks, no sounds of dishes falling or the fire alarm going off. A great evening."

She's having a mojito. I'm having the bottomless rootbeer float.I was surprised by the pig out and not in a good way. Apparently when the menu states hardwood smoked bacon what it really means is droopy regular bacon. It really had no flavor. I mentioned this to our waitress & apparently she informed her manager.His name was Shawn. He was a nice guy but really... do you have to mention your name in every other sentence? We talked for a bit after he comped the burger, over our objections I must add. I'm giving them 4 stars for this action. The food wasn't a winner this evening."

I ordered a burning love burger and my wife is getting spinach dip. As far as the pretzel appetizer is concerned it really is nothing more than hot dough. Would I order it again, probably not. The Burning Love burger was good as always. It seemed though that I didn't get very many fries in the basket. The root beer float was yummy as always too."
12/9/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,eEGxpQh7oZ3mZyuX_6Je0g,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,So we're back at Red Robin. My red royalty card entitled me to a free gingerbread milkshake. My wife made vomiting sounds when she was informed of this. But the reality was that it was a very tasty shake. It was accompanied by the metal shake container as well.I ordered a Tropical sunburn burger as my meal and Yukon chips and onion dip as an appetizer. The Yukon chips were a $2 menu item. The chips themselves were tasty. The onion dip was powdered & tasted like it was from a box. Another item not to be bothered with.The Tropical Sunburn Burger sounded interesting & the pineapple mango slaw was quite tasty. It'll be a burger that I'll order again. But I won't be ordering the sweet potato fries. They are two thinly cut & have no flavor whatsoever.
4/11/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,9RzglFia_9vAPSfdBPIS0g,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,I ordered a chophouse burger for dinner this evening along with the bottomless root beer float. We hadn't been to Red Robin in quite sometime mainly owing to having outrageously busy work schedules. The burger was excellent but I drank too many floats before it arrived. It was nice to receive a red royalty discount of 10% off the bill.(4/7/13)
5/27/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,yKG2LjMhkYBiGwWlTIudtA,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,(5/18/13) Coming after 10pm on a Saturday night is a good choice. I ordered a bottomless root beer float and a 5 alarm burger. Ryan was our server. Everything was great and tasty.That 5 alarm burger is very spicy! It has both fresh jalape<f1>os and fried jalape<f1>os. I once again had the bottomless root beer float. Red Robin is my burger comfort food restaurant.(5/25/13) Matt is our server on this visit. I'm having a fiery ghost burger with coleslaw and sweet potato fries. I also ordered a Hawaiian smoothy. If I thought the 5 alarm burger was spicy the fiery ghost burger made sure I would never repeat that mistake. Dang that burger was hot!!! The sweet potato fries weren't all that special but the Hawaiian Kiss Smoothy was excellent. It was pretty crowded Saturday night but we got a booth in the bar right away & it wasn't long till the food came out. Being a Red Royalty member was nice because we got one of our items for free.
6/16/2013,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,rBk4iqLmANf6Jg-aJ4fQ1Q,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"(6/15/2013) Well its a Saturday night and the place is filling up with kids. I ordered another Hawaiian heart throb smoothie. My wife is having sweet tea. We ordered the chips & French onion dip & the full order of riblets off the $9 appetizer menu.First off the chips were cold even though some of them still had a lot of oil on them. The French onion dip tasted like a packet of French onion soup mix was dumped into some cream. Despite these problems we ate it all because the $9 riblets were worse. How much worse you may ask? Well for $9 you receive 8 riblets on a bed of the same chips that came with the dip. The eight riblets might have equaled three full size ribs. Like any ribs the riblets were 95% bone and 5% meat. The riblets were also barely warm & had almost no flavor or sauce. My wife said we would never order them again & I concurred.My wife ordered chicken strips as her main meal. There were three strips altogether with french fries. I felt daring & ordered the Beserker Burger which was promoting some movie. I should've stuck to the regular menu. The Beserker came on a red platter with a hammered aluminum cup around the fries. The cup had no bottom so it had to be kept on the platter. Still its a step in the right direction...The burger did not have a wrapper around it. It did have a useless wooden paddle speared through its center advertising the movie. When I tried picking up the burger to eat it, it fell apart. I had to eat it with a knife and fork. It had some special onion straws on it that tasted no differently than the onion straws found on any other burger.The highlight of the burger was the spicy pickles. The pickles were crunchy & seasoned nicely.Now on to the service or lack of it from our server Stephanie. I can't think of a lot of excuses why she seemed to think that my smoothie would refill itself. And I can't forgive waiting 15 minutes for her to remember to put the drink order in with the bartender! Empty plates sat on the table waiting to be removed. She wasn't personable in any manner & made me wish that one of our regular servers had been working the bar that evening. What made it worse in my eyes was the fact that the burger was my birthday burger.I think we'll just go on weekday nights. The three stars are for the pickles and the smoothie only."
1/23/2014,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,40I1ONL6XJXZTCEve_PNTQ,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"So seven months later we are back at Red Robin.  (1/23/14) They have a new signature burger called the smoke and pepper burger a pepper lover's delight. I thought ok that sounds good and like the berserker burger on my last visit it was a disappointment. But I'm getting ahead of myself. .. Since the last time we were there the menu had been completely redesigned and prices had gone up. The bar area was very cold as well. It was cold to the point that I had to put my jacket on. The manager blamed our table's proximity to the door but I couldn't feel any heat coming through any of the three vents near our booth. So I ordered the newest burger. My wife had the Arctic cod and chips.  She seemed to enjoy her meal. I had a sweet tea and a bottomless root beer float. I've always enjoyed the root beer floats and this time was no exception. They had changed the composition by putting the ice cream on the top instead of putting it on the bottom. I got through the original and a refill before I was full. The smoke and pepper burger was on a ciabatta roll. It had peppered bacon and ketchup with pepper in it. You really couldn't taste the pepper at all. Strangely even though I could feel the heat of the sandwich it was barely warm. The fries were cold as well. I ate maybe half of the burger before I pulled it apart to see what was peppered. I had thought that the burger would be peppered but it wasn't it just had a smear of peppered ketchup, very disappointing. The highlight of the meal was spending time with my wife and the root beer float. I really need to consult my Yelp reviews before I order there again. The stars are for our server Lydia who gave us great service and the float only."
4/13/2014,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,9h43iYHYAo-zW78AmuSUNg,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"I'm sitting in the main dining room for the first time since the restaurant opened. There aren't very many children here on a Sunday afternoon, good to know. My server's name is Kiel. He seems like a nice guy. I'm having a Burning Love burger with bottomless fries and a root beer float.  I eagerly await my meal. The burger and fries were hot and tasty. The burger had a roasted jalape<f1>o pepper skewered to the top of the bun. It was delicious as well. I love their root beer floats!  Kiel was attentive and fun and I greatly enjoyed my meal."
6/16/2014,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,SvxzHXxYuvLctW5cRdJuYA,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,"(5/25/14) We are eating in the bar area this evening.  Kiel is our server. I'm going to be having the Burning Love burger with fiery ghost pepper sauce. My wife is having the clucks and fries. Everything was decent but nothing stood out. It seems like every time I go there to eat the place is empty. I think that the decline in food with actual flavors is responsible for that.(6/15/14) My wife and I went here tonight for my birthday hamburger. We were served by an usually chipper server named Ryan. My wife had no appetite so she ordered a bowl of onion soup. I had the Cantina Jack burger. Both selections were poor choices as we were to discover later in the meal. I also had a bottomless root beer float, something that I am fond of, this evening however the float was more ice cream than root beer. It was very difficult to chug it down. My wife's onion soup was served in a tiny bowl and a third of it was a slice of bread with melted cheese draped over it.The Cantina Jack burger was limp. It said on the menu that it had mild green chilis but I had to tear the burger apart to find less than half a teaspoon of chili paste at the center of the burger, how disappointing. The burger had no flavor and it's limpness prevented it from being lifted and not falling apart in my hands. They should never have abandoned the burger wrappers. Ryan was trying overly hard to see if I could drink 9 root beer floats,  a goal that I had no intention of surpassing. He offered the last one to me as a to go cup placing the empty cup on the table. I should've just left at that point but I tried to pour the float into the cup and poured it down the front of my pants instead."

The restaurant itself is pretty empty. We have ordered a bonanza of appetizers consisting of a shorty stack of onion rings,  artichoke dip and wings maui-style.First impressions of the appetizers are that the artichoke dip is served in a tiny bowl with approximately 20 chips.My wife wasn't pleased by it so I passed on it. The shorty stack of onion rings had six batter dipped onion rings that were very tasty. My wife had the wings as her main course. She said that they were alright. I had been looking forward to eating a burning love burger. But once again they changed its composition so it was but a shell of its formerly spicy self. Cross another burger off of my favorite list. I again had the root beer floats. Matt made sure that a refill was always within reach. Without decent company and good service the rating this afternoon would've been in the 2 star range. This time the service carried the day."

We've ordered a short stack of onion rings to start and I'll be having a Burning Love burger. Red Robin has gone back to putting the roasted jalape<f1>o pepper on the top of the burger but they've removed the seeds so it hasn't got any kick to it. The burger itself was hearty but had no distinctive flavor as it did when it first debuted. I had my standard bottomless root beer float as well as sweet potato fries. I need to remember to look at my reviews before thinking about coming here again.
4/26/2015,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,oANcKf3tp6vlw40gFW6dZg,yumgsa9m02CACzq0dHZP7Q,And here we are again. .. This time I have a gift card that makes the potential angst less since most of the cost will be covered by someone else. I have ordered the obligatory root beer float and a fiery ghost burger. I doubt that there will be any hint of the fiery ghost chilies either in the sauce or the cheese. Our server is Ryan and he recognized us or at least was good at pretending to. The restaurant is pretty much empty. The food came and... it was average. I have to stop ordering their burgers and see if their other items are any good. I keep saying that I need to check my past reviews but if I do I probably won't ever eat there again.

When we arrived they had a sign out for a Sunday brunch from 1000 - 1430. We arrived about 1445. They were still serving the brunch and it seemed to be more appealing than the lunch menu.I started out with chicken Marsala, squash and zucchini,  sausages and scalloped potatoes.  I thought that the food was very good. For my next plate I had macaroni and cheese and a cinnamon bun. I finished with a small bowl of chocolate mousse and a slice of trespass leche. I am so full that I could burst! I'm looking forward to our next weekend visit.  Service as far as clearing plates and refilling drinks was concerned was very swift."

Today is our second visit to their fabulous Sunday buffet. We were seated after a brief wait and a friendly waiter took our drink order and we proceeded to the brunch. It seems almost wrong to say that it's a breakfast buffet. Buffet seems too plebian to honor the food being presented. Brunch on the other hand evokes a dining experience where one's senses are fully engaged. Everything presented smells delicious. Everything that I put on my plate was seasoned perfectly and tasted great when eaten together, savory and sweet complimented each other with perfect balance. We also had a nice talk with the manager. I think this will become a regular Sunday destination for us."

Erin at The Art of Massage recommended The Common Market as a store that had the elusive watermelon flavored beer that I'd been searching for.Finding the store was a bit difficult but the easiest way to find it is if you know where Phat Burrito is... The large parking lot across the street from it buts up to The Common Market's parking lot.It looked like the world was going to end this afternoon as I parked the car & went inside. Immediately I saw beer. Bottles, cans, six packs... A lot of the brands I'd never heard of & I began to feel the beer sucking me deeper into the store. Fortunately I found the beer I was looking for in a refrigerated cooler. I bought 4 six packs & ran to the car. It looked like they had a little restaurant inside. Hopefully I can come back & check it out."
1/3/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,2cpTIILlHT8YDQBnB6RMMw,YZyzJVGQDgsOBS098JDR7A,I had the occasion to visit on New Year's Eve around 8pm. The place was pretty full but there were still tables available. We got a table & our server was there in a couple minutes to take our order. I ordered the Irish Nachos. This dish was based on the homemade chips with the usual nacho toppings including fresh jalapeno. It was good. I ate most of it & it was a good sized appetizer.For my main course I had the fish & chips. There were four pieces of fish that had a nice coating of batter on them. The fish inside was hot & moist. Yummy! I decided to try their Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. That was a major mistake. I was brought a slice of something that resembled cheesecake with shaving gel on top. It had no flavor or discernible taste. I even tried scraping the gel part off to just sample the cheesecake & it had no taste either. So that was a letdown.The other thing I found troubling was the beer/wine list. The font was so tiny that I had difficulty reading it. Even using reading glasses I was unable to see the offerings except for Woodchuck Cider. I wound up having a couple Black Russians instead. On an interesting note our server asked me if I wanted a tall cocktail or a short one. Thankfully I opted for the short ones.Our server was a very pleasant girl. I think her name was Crystal. I think I'll probably go back since my wife enjoyed the food & sample some of the Irish dishes.
1/10/2012,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,qrbYb1bCv5oRcEF40V6rNw,YZyzJVGQDgsOBS098JDR7A,"Well as luck would have it my wife decided that she wanted to go back for dinner tonight. I brought a pair of reading glasses so I could finally take a look at their beer/wine list. I ordered the Irish Onion Soup & the Irish Nachos. My wife ordered the Spud Soup & a Cobb Salad. Strangely enough the soups were brought out first then the nachos & the salad.The nachos were meh tasting. I think the only flavor came from the extra jalapenos I had them put on. My wife wasn't happy with her Cobb salad. Everything we ordered had very little flavor, except for the sweet tea. I think we got the dregs of the sweet tea container with our first glasses. The tea improved throughout the meal.I ordered a piece of Key Lime pie for dessert. It had no flavor. But I took the decorative lime slice & squeezed the juice from it out onto the slice of pie. That really woke it up.We both agreed when we left that the meal wasn't anything special. Too bad."
10/24/2009,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,Ep4mQO6q0NAyv42ZtxlhXw,S0EZSHGPt1gd7FzFC_donA,My wife and I have been eating at Bamboo 7 since it opened a couple years ago. It is a nice small restaurant with great food and reasonable prices. The food has always been consistent whether we go for lunch or dinner. We like the place so much that the staff knows what we like to drink & what appetizers & main courses we are most likely to have. We have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants in the Charlotte metro area but we prefer eating at Bamboo 7.

We started off with the fried wontons that are given to every table. There was something off about the wontons both in flavor and texture. We mentioned our concerns to the waitress who laughed at us! Seriously wtf? We spoke to the owner a bit later and she gave us a fresh bowl but the problem remained. Strike #1. I ordered Szechuan Beef as my entree. I ordered it hot and spicy and it came out mild. Strike #2. Apparently the waitress didn't see any problem even when it was pointed out to her that no red peppers were present. My wife's meal and that of her friend's were also bland and tasteless. What a shame. We've been dining here since they opened.

2/12/2013,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,dGOXw8kmPYc63opnP0joQA,S0EZSHGPt1gd7FzFC_donA,"Here we are again... 2/3/13  My last review was 9 months ago! It was nice to see that there were a couple other diners that evening. I started off with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup followed by what I call an endless soup. The menu calls it Vietnamese rice noodle soup with beef. It comes in an oversize bowl & I'm lucky if I can make the level drop 2"" before I'm full. I like the soup because its loaded with tender beef. The broth is excellent too. Its a combination of very subtle flavors much like a fine wine.My wife had Crispy Tofu & Beef with Broccoli. All in all it was a very pleasant evening."

I was literally amazed by what happened next. As I know and others who have eaten here know the food is consistently excellent.What emerged from the kitchen was a huge plate of Moo Shi Pork & six pancakes. After some light banter between Anna & myself she demonstrated to me exactly how to fill the pancakes. My efforts looked like a toddler attempting to stuff a burrito shell with Legos. It was great too. I really can't wait to go back & try the chicken & shrimp versions.When it came time to get to go boxes Anna went the extra distance & wrapped up the leftovers into pancakes for me to take home. I've never had that level of dedication to detail at any restaurant I've ever eaten at. Bamboo 7 has the best service period.

Tonight it was hot & sour soup followed by fried pork dumplings & Moo Shu Pork. I couldn't resist ordering it again. It was excellent just like it was the last time. Anna once again went above & beyond my expectations to make a memorable meal for my wife & I.
4/28/2013,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,Ww0u8jHFuooCvMXEGo1qUg,S0EZSHGPt1gd7FzFC_donA,"(4/21/2013) My teeth absolutely ache tonight.  I need soft food and here we are at Bamboo 7. Poor Anna.  Her restaurant is empty. But it makes for a very private dining experience for my wife and I.  I'm going to order steamed pork dumplings, crabmeat and asparagus soup and moo shu beef. I know that everything will be delicious. And like always it is. Zit was a perfect meal."
7/14/2013,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,F9VnJQmkIuHm1wYLGQOFeg,S0EZSHGPt1gd7FzFC_donA,"(7/5/13) Well well well Bamboo 7 is actually full of people. I guess that July 5th is a popular evening for Chinese food. Anyway I ordered fried tofu, pork fried dumplings,  an egg roll and white corn bisque. I'm having moo shu beef as my main course. Gingerale is the drink of choice since lemonade isn't offered anymore. I really appreciate Anna's flair for presentation both in having the Moo Shu Beef made for me & also rolling it up into egg roll skins. As always it was a very flavorful & enjoyable meal."

Mac seems to be really frazzled, but I'm  not  sure  why. There are very few diners in his section. My glass is empty. Mac asks if I  want a refill. I say yes and give him a sceptical  look. Now when we were seated there was a party of four across  from  me  that got up as we were sitting down. The half hour that we were there I got  to  stare at a table  full of dirty dishes. No one made any attempt  to  bus the table.The campfire beef was a couple pieces of pot roast that had been pressure  cooked or boiled. The meat was nice and tender. There were carrots, potatoes  and two half ears of corn. Everything  was  very tasty with the exception  of  the  corn muffins. They were dried out and had no flavor  at all. The blackberry  iced tea was refreshing  but also had no flavor. What a shame."
4/30/2014,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,2ykzA4TkX_V5AldoJHncPg,9Kb9ZRxBgS2c0ahuN1tbNA,"The reviews of this Subway were consistently bad. I avoided it for a month then thought that I was being silly.  I went into the restaurant and it was perfectly normal. A nice young lady named Ashley made me a very nice foot long spicy Italian sub on Italian herb bread and got me a dozen chocolate chip cookies. She knew how to make the sandwich and delivered it to me in a friendly,  polite,  and professional manner. I will be returning tomorrow for another wonderful sub."
10/14/2014,1,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,#NAME?,9Kb9ZRxBgS2c0ahuN1tbNA,"Well today showed me again why this particular Subway receives consistently low ratings. I went in for a cold cut combo. It was prepared by one of the owners. I should've been paying greater attention to how the roll was sliced as the girl cut it all the way through instead of mostly as a sub should be cut. As it was it fell apart in my lap. Not good.  The woman also had no idea how to process a Subway gift card. It was one of those moments where you just shake your head and wonder at how some people are able to function.  Note to self, ask for Christina on the next visit."
2/19/2015,1,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,ahRmuL9bNjnHuP6HG066XQ,9Kb9ZRxBgS2c0ahuN1tbNA,So this Subway  has now  hired  some  new workers. They can make the sandwiches  they just don't  have  any recollection  of what it is that the customer  wants up and including  the  type of sandwich. When I  say that I  don't  want  it  toasted  it means just that. I  don't  appreciate  being asked three  additional  times if I  want it toasted or even questioning  my choice  altogether. I'm  getting sick of this collective  amnesia  that has suddenly  graced this eatery.
9/12/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,i8of5SH3Kk1pgbrfqsYX2g,NgSbsVx22tGYX8tKSsyolw,"I've been working at Carolina Pavilion these past couple weeks & I've been eating my dinners at Hooters. It has a couple advantages over the collection of fast food restaurants at this mall. First are the very attractive waitresses, second is that its a sit down restaurant. Its the only sit down restaurant left after Rafferty's shut down.I've been to Hooters numerous times for car club events and the like but I've never had an opportunity to eat there multiple nights. Over the years I've tried most of their food & discovered that 99% of it is average at best. I do like the Buffalo Shrimp with their 911 sauce.But I digress... Last week I sampled their burgers. I can only really compare them to Red Robin and there is no comparison. Red Robin cleans their clock. I know for sure that I'll never eat another Hooters burger again. I tried the fish & chips Monday night. I ordered it & the damn company phone rang. Grr... Why is it that supervisors always show up & want to yack at the worst possible times? Anyhow I had to run out on my meal. I asked the bartender to tell my waitress Erika that I would be right back. Unfortunately for me I managed to return half an hour later. Much to my surprise Erika had asked the kitchen to re-fire my meal. I tipped her extremely well. Her act of kindness is the only reason that Hooters got a fourth star. The waitresses go above & beyond for customers & that's what I appreciate."
9/28/2012,2,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,F8s9ELsHAPnE4FrLE6dJWw,NgSbsVx22tGYX8tKSsyolw,I really don't know why I keep going back here. The service was pretty bad this time around and the food was worse. I ordered steak quesadillas and they were filled with steakum! Wtf? THe only thing that Hooters can make edible is their Buffalo Shrimp. Carolina Pavilion desperately needs another sit down restaurant.
10/25/2015,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,PR8dfST0tPOsHWwBSgrKow,8P2lLn68_RY-DMP876rIBw,So let's  see . .. My wife  complained  to  Chili's  corporate  about the poor service  and  filthy conditions  of  the  Chili's  restaurant  on Hwy 51. They sent her $25 in Chili  bucks as compensation . So we decided to use them at another Chili's  this time in Blakeney . Our server is Daniella . She was very prompt  with  our drink order and with taking our order. The watermelon  marguerita  is delicious .Our appetizers  were hot and  flavorful . I can't  wait  to  see  what my burger  is like. Everything was very good. Daniella was very attentive and the atmosphere was worlds better than the location on highway 51.
6/27/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,yuggNYbRDzi91pd3p7KH5w,dDD6is_GS35RcXtl4QvP_w,I had a birthday coupon for a free burger. We had been going to Ruby Tuesday's pretty regularly over the past year to use emailed special coupons that generally gave us $10 off a meal. As we ate there we came to the conclusion that Ruby Tuesday's food is average at best. So we stopped going.When I received the burger coupon I thought well its free... So my wife and I went to the Ruby Tuesday at Torringdon Place and I had my free burger. I have to say that it really wasn't anything special & I think that's a shame. The closest burger joint is Red Robin over in Torringdon Market and just having the burger wrapped so it doesn't fall apart is such a step upwards that it makes them unique & special. I guess the next time I find myself at Ruby Tuesday's will be for my birthday next year.
6/7/2016,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,#NAME?,hnN3SAfSThUHPEq4rLtC2g,"Really  not much to say, Firehouse  Subs  is a very clean space with polite  and  professional  workers no matter which franchise  you go to and the Northlake  location  is no exception. I've   filled two online orders with them that have been filled correctly  and  promptly."
6/21/2016,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,C2xVHATgOklmqiPLiRus8A,hnN3SAfSThUHPEq4rLtC2g,"There's  an aspect  to Firehouse  that very few people are aware of, I've  found that they consistently  have better brisket in their  subs than a good many of the BBQ restaurants  in the area. And more  importantly  it's consistently  good. You really never know  if you're  going  to  wind  up  with  a  mouth  full of fat, meat or a combination  at most places. Firehouse  gives you tender delicious  brisket  all the time. The rewards  program  also makes it very easy to get free food in very little  time. The Northlake  employees  are very hard working, friendly and polite."
11/27/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,RmYCCru_fs9flayiTbwKGw,5nisFSuX7Bn9BHME5Lrqyg,"Good sit down lunch of baked ziti and meatballs. I had a refillable Fanta Orange too. It really hit the spot. I was in & out in 30 minutes. I have to say that even though the restaurant is very spartan that the food is cheap, hot & hits the spot in a reasonable amount of time that's perfect for a potential juror."
6/7/2012,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,LNDTzPu39QMZ3vqIrObmaA,aYt9gp9i73-RCJFy7FnhBg,First impressions are that this place is identical to the restaurant that was here before with the exception of the prices for nigiri being noticeably higher. Sweet tea apparently translates to unsweetened tea and add your own sugar.The salmon nigiri that I ordered looked nice but didn't melt in my mouth like pieces that I've had at other restaurants would. They do however have the best green tea ice cream that I have ever had anywhere!!! The third star is for the ice cream.
5/27/2013,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,5hBSPPsrOvu3KuBK6M2XCA,bE_cw4gUA4KqfA5CFVEzYg,"(5/26/13)  We keep passing this place but never tried it. Our server is Taylor.  The half order of nachos I ordered was nothing spectacular. It was good bar food but little else. I had read Ben's review while waiting for the appetizer to appear. I was hoping that there would be an improvement.I ordered a bomber sandwich with onion rings for my meal. My wife ordered a dozen teriyaki wings. She was happy with her meal. I was actually surprised by mine. I wasn't expecting anything more than average, but the meal exceeded expectations.The first thing I noticed about the bomber was that the bread seemed off in some way. I seemed as though it was falling apart & that the bottom of the sandwich was on top. I flipped the sandwich over & discovered that it was breaded with two giant pretzels! Very unique! The shaved ribeye was very good & though the sandwich was the messiest thing I'd ever eaten I thought it was very good.The onion rings looked like they had a lot of breading but it was deceptive. When I took a bite out of one I discovered that the onion ring inside was doubled up. They were very tasty too. I finished the meal off with a slice of Creamsicle cheesecake. It was very good. The flavors were not overwhelming. We both had sweet tea & our server Taylor always made sure that we had plenty to drink. We will return."
9/28/2012,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,ZH0jLHryWnkMdw9ObI_How,AL2w0DAM7-6sJkBVI2qtHg,"Seems like a nice restaurant. The atmosphere reminds me of someone's kitchen, homey. The menu had a lot of choices I ordered gyoza and wasabi shumai to start and about 20 pieces of sushi. The server was prompt with my sweet tea and a pair of chopsticks, I like him already. My sushi was excellent. The presentation of the food sets a very high bar to follow for the other sushi restaurants in Charlotte. The sushi chef came over to talk with me about why half of the salmon was fattier than the other pieces. He explained that there would be a taste difference as well. The difference was very subtle. Overall I very much enjoyed my lunch here today. They also had fresh uni. Uni seems to be something that most restaurants say they have until you order it and they tell you that it was all consumed. Fujimi's uni had a very subtle taste that leaves me wondering where it was harvested. I look forward to my next visit."
4/15/2014,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,OCgEn5j60QVXZgQ1hioKaw,en8csXJNIkoBOOMawtyuTQ,My first time trying this place. It was a toss up between it and a subway with one star ratings. It wasn't a very difficult decision. There was another patron there when I entered. I took a look at the menu and knew I'd be coming here for lunch on a daily basis.  I ordered a toasted Italian sub which I'm eating now.  It's delicious!
4/16/2014,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,g9rTVCoGJHgLpq1QKZvOqA,en8csXJNIkoBOOMawtyuTQ,"I decided to try the large jerk chicken rice box today.  The owner changed it to a jerk curry rice box. Man there's some incredible hot flavors produced when combining those two spicy flavors. I'm going to be able to snack on this all day, which is another plus. I can't wait to sample their Greek food tomorrow!"
4/15/2016,3,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,LN6k33cR4fwSYKleRm6Gsw,en8csXJNIkoBOOMawtyuTQ,"Today's  rice bowl  is a Bullrider  with steak and shrimp. A few drops of death sauce  and  I'll  be  on my way.Or so I  thought , sigh one of their grill people  decided  to  get cute and added a lot of green  peppers without  asking  me  first. He wasn't  happy  when I   told him that I  hate green  peppers  but he should  have  asked  me  first before  he got stupid .  Too bad that Raj isn't  here because  it wouldn't  have  been  an issue."
5/6/2016,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,58L9yR-oJ4ZzLXaq4lPKTA,en8csXJNIkoBOOMawtyuTQ,Well Raj is here today so that's  an ironclad  guarantee  that  my curry jerk rice bowl with  steak  and  shrimp  will be made correctly. I'm  wondering  how  spicy  it will be since I   told him to go wild.And it was like eating a blowtorch! My fault  but at least I  know  just  how  hot it  can get.
10/25/2015,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,B32rMzbZx4kCAjoUzTTDbA,8y9Bu148oa-RMW9axEg-Jg,"So a month  ago  I ate  at Midwood  for the first  time  and got the bacon  wrapped  jalape<f1>os, an angry  orchard  hard cider and a well fed  combo platter. The platter has you choosing  a combination  of  proteins. The proteins that I sampled were ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. Everything  was  excellent, the ribs were dry and a bit under seasoned. My dogs greatly enjoyed  them however. They still  won't  give up the bones a month later!Tonight we went back to Midwood for dinner. My wife got a salad, sweet tea and an order of smoked wings. I ordered a pig out combo plate with pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket and smoked sausage. Our waitress, Cassie, had told us about the rib special. I happened to remark that when we had been here last that I had ordered the ribs in my well fed combo plate and that they were very dry and lacking flavor. She offered to let me try a sample of them but I refused. A manager came over and attempted the same offer, then offered to remove from our bill the price of a half rack of ribs and two free desserts. It's hard to refuse an offer like that! We both had the pecan cobbler for dessert. It's like pecan pie but the pecans are minced rather than whole nut meats. All in all we left feelings stuffed with plenty of leftovers for meals into the week and some treats for our dogs as well."
12/31/2015,5,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,RQZawA6IDEdd8at1gHbDsA,8y9Bu148oa-RMW9axEg-Jg,So we're  trying Midwood  for lunch. I've  ordered  the bacon wrapped  jalape<f1>os  to start with a brisket  stuffed  tater for the main course. My wife is having  the  smoked  wings and an order  of  fries. So far so good. The restaurant  is packed this afternoon  which is always  a  good  sign. The appetizer  has arrived! The bacon is smoky  and delicious  and the jalape<f1>os  and a nice even heat to the experience. The root beer  is made by Stewart's.Well I made it through  most of the stuffed   tater before  I  gave  up. All in all  it was a good  lunch.
6/22/2016,4,q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw,dKWzpAmEqEEYFwxI2Pv93g,8y9Bu148oa-RMW9axEg-Jg,"(6/11/16) We're  here  for  my birthday  dinner. I wanted  to  come  to  a  place  where  I  know  the  food  is  good  rather  than  someplace  uptight and  pretentious. I'm   having a dragon mystic  cider and we've  ordered  nachos  Libre with pulled  pork. The cider tasted sort of strange. It tasted like apples but it had an underlying vanilla flavor as well.The nachos libra was a platter of standard nachos with pulled pork. It wasn't very spicy though haberneros were on the ingredient list. I ate more of them than I did my main course. For my main course I had a ""well fed"" platter that had a half rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork and bbq chicken. I brought most of it home to make into sandwiches for work the next day. For sides I had collard greens and baked beans. Everything was very good and very filling. I usually save some room for dessert but this time I couldn't eat another bite."

I've ordered  the  bacon  wrapped  jalape<f1>os  and an order of Nachos  Libre with brisket. The jalape<f1>os  are a reliable  appetizer  and we've had the Nachos  Libre before  with  pulled  pork so the brisket should  be  an interesting  change. It's really strange how few people  are here dining with  us on this late afternoon, it's so quiet.So the food arrived and I made it through  half of the nachos  and three of the jalape<f1>os. I took the rest home. I had some pecan cobbler a la  mode and we went home. The pecan cobbler would've been better with whole pecans rather than having them ground to bits."
